# Dome Keeper: Moleman

This is a community mod for the game Dome Keeper that adds a new playable character, known as the Moleman. The Moleman digs tunnels by sending burrowing tunnelers, creating an empty pocket on the other side. When travelling in tunnels, the Moleman gradually damages each tile, eventually breaking the tunnels apart.

## Important note

This mod is a work in progress. It's not yet complete, missing custom art assets and sound effects. It will also need to be balanced properly in relation to the default keepers in the game.

## Known issues

* Save games are not supported, loading a saved game can crash the game and will not restore any constructed tunnels.

## Installation

1. Download the zip from [Releases](https://github.com/leiftiger/dome-keeper-moleman/releases)
2. Copy the contents of `Mod Loader` (`patch.gd` and `patch.pck`) to your game's installation folder (Right click the game => Properties => Local Files => Browse)
3. Set your game's launch options to `--script patch.gd` (Right click the game => Properties => General => Launch Options)
4. Copy the `Mods` directory to `%AppData%/Godot/app_userdata/Dome Keeper/`

Optional: Install the [demo rock textures mod](https://github.com/leiftiger/dome-keeper-demo-rock-textures), which makes digging with the Moleman more visually appealing.
